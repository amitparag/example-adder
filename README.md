This is an example project, to show how to use Gepetto's tools.It has been modified to work with torchscript.

The example-add app is based on [Pytorch-TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html)

First, get libtorch:

wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/nightly/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip

unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip

We can now run the following commands to build the application from within the example-app/ folder:

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..

cmake --build . --config Release
